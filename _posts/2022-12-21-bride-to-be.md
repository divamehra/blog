An emotional out written expression to a sister about to get married.

#### Much Love

"I have tear in my eyes, 
For the thought of you being the Bride..

Glittering with grace,
And a heart full of praise...
Sending you to fly,
With the dark eyes biding you Goodbye..

Around you see,
Many wishing you with plenty...
Blessings in abundance,
And gifts so rich unseen...

Dressed in bling,
People rejoicing with a swing...
Dance like a boss,
And adore the random flaws...

Your steps moving out of the way,
Will be recalling each moment of joy and play...
Fights that stood us still,
And curses that was not to be Fulfilled..

I pray for you in abundance,
Like a princess adorned with pride...
I will send you with Greetings,
That you always keep a Smile..."
